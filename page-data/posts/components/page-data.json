Digital synthesizers often emulate classic analog designs. Sound is\ncontrollable by the operator by means of circuits or virtual stages that may\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oscillators typically produce waveforms (such as sawtooth, sine, or pulse\nwaves) with different timbres.</li>\n<li>Low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) produce waveforms used to modulate\nparameters, such as the pitch of oscillators (producing vibrato).</li>\n<li>Voltage-controlled filter (VCFs) – \"shape\" the sound generated by the\noscillators in the frequency domain, often under the control of an envelope or\nLFO. These are essential to subtractive synthesis.</li>\n<li>Envelope generators – provide envelope modulation to \"shape\" the volume or\nharmonic content of the produced note in the time domain with the principal\nparameters being attack, decay, sustain and release. These are used in most\nforms of synthesis. ADSR control is provided by envelope generators.</li>\n<li>Voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs) control the volume or gain of the audio\nsignal. VCAs can be modulated by other components, such as LFOs and envelopes.</li>\n<li>After the signal generated by one (or a mix of more) VCOs has been modified by\nfilters and LFOs, and its waveform has been shaped (contoured) by an ADSR\nenvelope generator, it then passes on to one or more voltage-controlled\namplifiers (VCAs). A VCA is a preamp that boosts (amplifies) the electronic\nsignal before passing it on to an external or built-in power amplifier, as\nwell as a means to control its amplitude (volume) using an attenuator. The\ngain of the VCA is affected by a control voltage (CV), coming from an envelope\ngenerator, an LFO, the keyboard or some other source.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Filter</h2>\n<p>Filters are particularly important in subtractive synthesis, being designed to\npass some frequency regions (or \"bands\") through unattenuated while\nsignificantly attenuating (\"subtracting\") others. The low-pass filter is most\nfrequently used, but band-pass filters, band-reject filters and high-pass\nfilters are also sometimes available.</p>\n<p>The filter may be controlled with a second ADSR envelope. An \"envelope\nmodulation\" (\"env mod\") parameter on many synthesizers with filter envelopes\ndetermines how much the envelope affects the filter. If turned all the way down,\nthe filter produces a flat sound with no envelope. When turned up the envelope\nbecomes more noticeable, expanding the minimum and maximum range of the filter.\nThe envelope applied on the filter helps the sound designer generating long\nnotes or short notes by moving the parameters up and down such as decay, sustain\nand finally release. For instance by using a short decay with no sustain, the\nsound generated is commonly known as a stab. Sound designers may prefer shaping\nthe sound with filter instead of volume.</p>\n<h2>Envelope</h2>\n<p>Envelopes control how sounds change over time. They may control parameters such\nas amplitude (volume), filters (frequencies), or pitch. The most common envelope\nis the ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attack time is the time taken for initial run-up of level from nil to peak,\nbeginning when the note is triggered.</li>\n<li>Decay time is the time taken for the subsequent run down from the attack level\nto the designated sustain level.</li>\n<li>Sustain level is the level during the main sequence of the sound's duration,\nuntil the key is released.</li>\n<li>Release time is the time taken for the level to decay from the sustain level\nto zero after the key is released.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>LFO</h2>\n<p>A low-frequency oscillator (LFO) generates an electronic signal, usually below\n20 Hz. LFO signals create a periodic control signal or sweep, often used in\nvibrato, tremolo and other effects. In certain genres of electronic music, the\nLFO signal can control the cutoff frequency of a VCF to make a rhythmic wah-wah\nsound, or the signature dubstep wobble bass.</p>\n<h2>Arpeggiator</h2>\n<p>An arpeggiator (arp) is a feature available on several synthesizers that\nautomatically steps through a sequence of notes based on an input chord, thus\ncreating an arpeggio. The notes can often be transmitted to a MIDI sequencer for\nrecording and further editing. An arpeggiator may have controls for speed,\nrange, and order in which the notes play; upwards, downwards, or in a random\norder. More advanced arpeggiators allow the user to step through a\npre-programmed complex sequence of notes, or play several arpeggios at once.\nSome allow a pattern sustained after releasing keys: in this way, a sequence of\narpeggio patterns may be built up over time by pressing several keys one after\nthe other. Arpeggiators are also commonly found in software sequencers. Some\narpeggiators/sequencers expand features into a full phrase sequencer, which\nallows the user to trigger complex, multi-track blocks of sequenced data from a\nkeyboard or input device, typically synchronized with the tempo of the master\nclock. Arpeggiators seem to have grown from the accompaniment system used in\nelectronic organs in the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s.</p>\n<h2>Controllers</h2>\n<p>Synthesizers are often controlled with electronic or digital keyboards or MIDI\ncontroller keyboards, which may be built into the synthesizer unit or attached\nvia connections such as CV/gate, USB, or MIDI. Keyboards may offer expression\nsuch as velocity sensitivity and aftertouch, allowing for more control over the\nsound. Other controllers include Ribbon controllers, which track the movement of\nthe finger across a touch-sensitive surface; wind controllers, played similarly\nto woodwind instruments; motion-sensitive controllers similar to video game\nmotion controllers; electronic drum pads, played similarly to the heads of a\ndrum kit; touchplates, which send signals depending on finger position and\nforce; controllers designed for microtonal tunings; touchscreen devices such as\ntablets and smartphones; and fingerpads.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Components","date":"2020-11-23","slug":"components"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"components"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1809294066","2793165914"]}
