The Hammond organ, introduced in 1935,\nwas the first electronic instrument to enjoy wide success. In 1948, the Canadian\nengineer Hugh Le Caine completed the electronic sackbut, a precursor to\nvoltage-controlled synthesizers, with keyboard sensitivity allowing for vibrato,\nglissando, and attack control.</p>\n<p>In 1957, Harry Olson and Herbert Belar completed the RCA Mark II Sound\nSynthesizer at the RCA laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. The instrument\nread punched paper tape that controlled an analog synthesizer containing 750\nvacuum tubes. It was acquired by the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center\nand used almost exclusively by Milton Babbitt, a composer at Princeton\nUniversity.</p>\n<h2>1960s – 1970s: Early years</h2>\n<p>The authors of Analog Days define \"the early years of the synthesizer\" as\nbetween 1964 and the mid-1970s, beginning with the debut of the Moog\nsynthesizer. Designed by American engineer Robert Moog, the synthesizer was\ncomposed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds, connected by patch\ncords. Moog developed a means of controlling pitch through voltage, the\nvoltage-controlled oscillator. This, along with Moog components such as\nenvelopes, noise generators, filters, and sequencers, became standards in the\nsynthesizer market.</p>\n<p>Around the same period, American engineer Don Buchla created the Buchla Modular\nElectronic Music System. Instead of a conventional keyboard, Buchla's system\nused touchplates which transmitted control voltages depending on finger position\nand force. However, the Moog's keyboard made it more accessible and marketable\nto musicians, and keyboards became the standard means of controlling\nsynthesizers. Moog and Buchla initially avoided the word synthesizer for their\ninstruments, as it was associated with the RCA synthesizer; however, by the\n1970s, \"synthesizer\" had become the standard term. In 1970, Moog launched a\ncheaper, smaller synthesizer, the Minimoog. The Minimoog was the first\nsynthesizer sold in music stores, and was more practical for live performance;\nit standardized the concept of synthesizers as self-contained instruments with\nbuilt-in keyboards.</p>\n<p>After retail stores started selling synthesizers in 1971, other synthesizer\ncompanies were established, including ARP in the US and EMS in the UK. ARP's\nproducts included the ARP 2600, which folded into a carrying case and had\nbuilt-in speakers, and the Odyssey, a rival to the Minimoog. The less expensive\nEMS synthesizers were used by European art rock and progressive rock acts\nincluding Brian Eno and Pink Floyd. Designs for synthesizers appeared in the\namateur electronics market, such as the \"Practical Electronics Sound\nSynthesiser\", published in Practical Electronics in 1973. By the mid-1970s, ARP\nwas the world's largest synthesizer manufacturer, though it closed in 1981.</p>\n<p>Early synthesizers were monophonic, meaning they could only play one note at a\ntime. Some of the earliest commercial polyphonic synthesizers were created by\nAmerican engineer Tom Oberheim, such as the OB-X (1979). In 1978, the American\ncompany Sequential Circuits released the Prophet-5, first fully programmable\npolyphonic synthesizer. The Prophet-5 used microprocessors for patch memory,\nallowing users to store sounds. This overcame a major difficulty in previous\nsynthesizers, which required users to adjust cables and knobs to change sounds,\nwith no guarantee of exactly recreating a sound. This facilitated a move from\nsynthesizers creating unpredictable sounds to producing \"a standard package of\nfamiliar sounds\". 1980s: Market growth and digital technology</p>\n<h2>1980s: Market growth and digital technology</h2>\n<p>The synthesizer market grew dramatically in the 1980s. 1982 saw the introduction\nof MIDI, a standardized means of synchronizing electronic instruments; it\nremains an industry standard. An influential sampling synthesizer, the Fairlight\nCMI, was released in 1979, with the ability to record and play back samples at\ndifferent pitches. Though its high price made it inaccessible to amateurs, it\nwas adopted by high-profile pop musicians including Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel.\nThe success of the Fairlight drove competition, improving sampling technology\nand lowering prices; early competing samplers included the E-mu Emulator in 1981\nand the Akai S-series in 1985.</p>\n<p>In 1983, Yamaha released the first commercially successful digital synthesizer,\nthe Yamaha DX7. Based on frequency modulation (FM) synthesis developed by\nStanford University engineer John Chowning, the DX7 remains one of the\nbestselling synthesizers in history and was the first synthesizer to sell over\n100,000 units. It was widely used in 1980s pop music. Compared to the \"warm\" and\n\"fuzzy\" sounds of analog synthesis, the DX7 was characterized by its \"harsh\",\n\"glassy\" and \"chilly\" sounds. Digital synthesizers typically contained preset\nsounds emulating acoustic instruments, with algorithms controlled with menus and\nbuttons. The Synclavier, a digital synthesizer made with FM technology licensed\nfrom Yamaha, offered features such as 16-bit sampling and built-in digital\nrecording. With a starting price of $13,000, its use was limited to\nuniversities, studios and wealthy artists.</p>\n<p>The success of the DX7 led to competing digital synthesizers. The Roland D-50\n(1987) blended Roland's linear arithmetic algorithm with samples, and was the\nfirst mass-produced synthesizer with built-in effects such as delay, reverb and\nchorus. In 1988, the Japanese manufacturer Korg released the M1, a digital\nsynthesizer workstation featuring sampled transients and loops; with over\n250,000 units sold, it remains the bestselling synthesizer in history. The\nadvent of digital synthesizers led to a downturn in interest in analog\nsynthesizers.</p>\n<h2>1990s – present: Software synthesizers and analog revival</h2>\n<p>1997 saw the release of ReBirth by Propellerhead Software and Reality by Seer\nSystems, the first software synthesizers that could be played in real time via\nMIDI. In 1999, an update to the music software Cubase allowed users to run\nsoftware instruments (including synthesizers) as plug-ins, triggering a\n\"torrent\" of new software instruments. Propellerhead's Reason, released in 2000,\noffered users a virtual \"rack\" of recognisable studio equipment. Whereas once\nthey had filled rooms, synthesizers now can be embedded on single microchips in\nany electronic device and accurately emulated by software.</p>\n<p>The market for patchable and modular synthesizers rebounded in the late 1990s.\nIn the 2000s, older analog synthesizers regained popularity, sometimes selling\nfor much more than their original prices. In the 2010s, new, affordable analog\nsynthesizers were introduced by companies including Moog, Korg, Arturia, and\nDave Smith Instruments. The renewed interest is credited to the appeal of\nimperfect \"organic\" sounds and simpler interfaces, and to modern surface-mount\ntechnology making analog synthesizers cheaper and faster to manufacture.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"History of Synthesizers","date":"2020-11-20","slug":"history-of-synthesizers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"history-of-synthesizers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1809294066","2793165914"]}
