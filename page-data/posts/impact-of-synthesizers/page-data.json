Switched-On Bach (1968), a bestselling\nalbum of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by Wendy Carlos,\ndemonstrated that synthesizers could be more than \"random noise machines\",\ntaking them to the mainstream. However, debates were held about the\nappropriateness of synthesizers in baroque music, and according to the Guardian\nthey were quickly abandoned in \"serious classical circles\".[</p>\n<p>The Moog was adopted by acts including the Doors, the Grateful Dead, the Rolling\nStones, the Beatles, and Keith Emerson. Emerson was the first major rock\nmusician to perform with the Moog and it became a trademark of his performances,\nhelping take his band Emerson, Lake &#x26; Palmer to global stardom; according to\nAnalog Days, the likes of Emerson, with his Moog performances, \"did for the\nkeyboard what Jimi Hendrix did for the guitar\".</p>\n<p>The portable Minimoog (1970), much smaller than the modular synthesizers before\nit, made synthesizers more common in live performance. The Minimoog took a place\nin mainstream black music, most notably in the work of Stevie Wonder, and in\njazz, such as the work of Sun Ra. It was also used by electronic artists such as\nKraftwerk, who used it on their albums Autobahn (1974) and The Man-Machine\n(1978), and later by Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Gary Numan. In the late\n1970s and the early 1980s, the Micromoog was widely used in the emerging disco\ngenre by artists including Abba and Giorgio Moroder. Some acts felt that using\nsynthesizers to create sounds was \"cheating\"; Queen wrote in their album liner\nnotes that they did not use them.</p>\n<p>Early synthesizers could only play one note at a time, making them suitable for\nbasslines, leads and solos. With the rise of polyphonic synthesizers in the 70s\nand 80s, \"the keyboard in rock once more started to revert to the background, to\nbe used for fills and atmosphere rather than for soloing\". Sampling, introduced\nwith the Fairlight synthesizer in 1979, has influenced all genres of music and\nhad a major influence on the development of electronic and hip hop music.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s, electronic music composers such as Jean Michel Jarre and Isao\nTomita released successful synthesizer-led instrumental albums. This influenced\nthe emergence of synthpop, a subgenre of new wave, from the late 1970s to the\nearly 1980s. The work of German krautrock bands such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine\nDream, British acts such as John Foxx, Gary Numan and David Bowie,\nAfrican-American acts such as George Clinton and Zapp, and Japanese electronic\nacts such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Kitaro were influential in the\ndevelopment of the genre. Gary Numan's 1979 hits \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" and\n\"Cars\" made heavy use of synthesizers. OMD's \"Enola Gay\" (1980) used distinctive\nelectronic percussion and a synthesized melody. Soft Cell used a synthesized\nmelody on their 1981 hit \"Tainted Love\". Nick Rhodes, keyboardist of Duran\nDuran, used various synthesizers including the Roland Jupiter-4 and Jupiter-8.\nChart hits include Depeche Mode's \"Just Can't Get Enough\" (1981), the Human\nLeague's \"Don't You Want Me\" and works by Ultravox.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, digital synthesizers were widely used in pop music. The Yamaha\nDX7, released in 1983, became a pop staple, used on songs by A-ha, Kenny\nLoggins, Kool &#x26; the Gang. Its \"E PIANO 1\" preset became particularly famous,\nespecially for power ballads, and was used by artists including Whitney Houston,\nChicago, Prince, Phil Collins, Luther Vandross, Billy Ocean, and Celine Dion.\nThe Roland TB-303 (1981), in conjunction with the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum\nmachines, became a foundation of electronic dance music genres such as house and\ntechno when producers acquired cheap second-hand units later in the decade. Korg\nM1 presets were widely used in 1990s house music, beginning with Madonna's 1990\nsingle \"Vogue\".</p>\n<p>Today, the synthesizer is used in nearly every genre of music. It is considered\nby the authors of Analog Days \"the only innovation that can stand alongside the\nelectric guitar as a great new instrument of the age of electricity ... Both led\nto new forms of music, and both had massive popular appeal.\" The authors draw a\nconnection to the synthesizer's origins in 1960s psychedelia to the raves and\nBritish \"second summer of love\" of the 1980s and the club scenes of the 1990s\nand 2000s. According to Fact in 2016, \"The synthesizer is as important, and as\nubiquitous, in modern music today as the human voice.\" It is one of the most\nimportant instruments in the music industry.[</p>\n<h2>Film and television</h2>\n<p>Synthesizers are common in film and television soundtracks. ARP synthesizers,\nfor example, were used to create sound effects for the 1977 science fiction\nfilms Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars, including the \"voice\" of\nthe robot R2-D2. In the 70s and 80s, synthesizers were used in the scores for\nthrillers and horror films including A Clockwork Orange (1971), Apocalypse Now\n(1979), The Fog (1980) and Manhunter (1986). They were also used to create\nthemes for television shows including Knight Rider (1982), Twin Peaks (1990) and\nStranger Things (2016).</p>\n<h2>Jobs</h2>\n<p>The rise of the synthesizer led to major changes in music industry jobs,\ncomparable to the earlier arrival of sound in film, which put live musicians\naccompanying silent films out of work. With its ability to imitate instruments\nsuch as strings and horns, the synthesizer threatened the jobs of session\nmusicians. For a period, the Moog was banned from use in commercial work, a\nrestriction negotiated by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). Robert\nMoog felt that the AFM had not realized that his instrument had to be studied\nlike any other, and instead imagined that \"all the sounds that musicians could\nmake somehow existed in the Moog â€” all you had to do was push a button that said\n'Jascha Heifetz' and out would come the most fantastic violin player\".</p>\n<p>Musician Walter Sear persuaded the AFM that the synthesizer demanded skill, and\nthe category of \"synthesizer player\" was accepted into the union; however,\nplayers were still subject to \"suspicion and hostility\" for several years. In\n1982, following a tour by Barry Manilow using synthesizers instead of an\norchestra, the British Musicians' Union attempted to ban synthesizers,\nattracting controversy. That decade, a few musicians skilled at programming the\npopular Yamaha DX7 found employment creating sounds for other acts.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Impact of Synthesizers","date":"2020-11-21","slug":"impact-of-synthesizers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"impact-of-synthesizers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1809294066","2793165914"]}
