Clones are\navailable as physical instruments and software. Companies that have sold\nsoftware clones include Arturia and Native Instruments. Behringer manufactures\nequipment modelled on instruments including the Minimoog, Pro-One, TB-303, and\ndrum machines such as the TR-808. Other synthesizer clones include the MiniMOD\n(a series of Eurorack modules based on the Minimoog), the Intellijel Atlantis\n(based on the SH-101), and the x0x Heart (based on the TB-303).</p>\n<p>Creating clones of older hardware is legal where the patents have expired. In\n1997, Mackie lost their lawsuit against Behringer as copyright law in the United\nStates did not cover their circuit board designs. In 2006, Roland and Behringer\nreached a settlement after Roland claimed Behringer's effects units were too\nsimilar to its Boss pedals.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Clones","date":"2020-11-24","slug":"clones"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"clones"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1809294066","2793165914"]}
