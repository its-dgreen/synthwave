Additive synthesis was used as early as on\nTeleharmonium in 1900s and Hammond organ in 1930s. Subtractive synthesis is\nstill utilized on various synths, including virtual analog synth.</p>\n<p>Subtractive synthesis uses oscillators to generate waveforms, then shapes them\nwith filters to remove or boost specific frequencies. FM synthesis was hugely\nsuccessful in the earliest digital synthesizers.</p>\n<p>Frequency modulation (FM) synthesis creates sounds by modulating one waveform\nwith the frequency of another; the resulting complex waveform can, in turn, be\nused to modulate another, and this another, and so on. FM synthesis can imitate\nacoustic sounds such as piano, strings and organs.</p>\n<p>Phase distortion synthesis is a method implemented on Casio CZ synthesizers. It\nreplaces the traditional analog waveform with a choice of several digital\nwaveforms which are more complex than the standard square, sine, and sawtooth\nwaves. This waveform is routed to a digital filter and digital amplifier, each\nmodulated by an eight-stage envelope. The sound can then be further modified\nwith ring modulation or noise modulation. Physical modelling synthesis is often\nimplemented as software synthesizers.</p>\n<p>Physical modelling synthesis is the synthesis of sound by using a set of\nequations and algorithms to simulate each sonic characteristic of an instrument,\nstarting with the harmonics that make up the tone itself, then adding the sound\nof the resonator, the instrument body, etc., until the sound realistically\napproximates the desired instrument. When an initial set of parameters is run\nthrough the physical simulation, the simulated sound is generated. Although\nphysical modeling was not a new concept in acoustics and synthesis, it was not\nuntil the development of the Karplus-Strong algorithm and the increase in DSP\npower in the late 1980s that commercial implementations became feasible. The\nquality and speed of physical modeling on computers improves with higher\nprocessing power.[citation needed] Analysis/resynthesis is typically used on the\nvocoder.</p>\n<p>Linear arithmetic synthesis is a form of synthesis developed by Roland that\nutilizes PCM samples for the attack of a waveform, and subtractive synthesis for\nthe rest of the envelope. This type of synthesis bridges the gap between the\nolder subtractive synthesis and the newer sample-based synthesis at a time where\nPCM samples would take up a substantial amount of the memory allotted. The first\nsynthesizer to debut with this form of synthesis was the Roland D-50 in 1987.</p>\n<p>Sample-based synthesis involves digitally recording a short snippet of sound\nfrom a real instrument or other source and then playing it back at different\nspeeds to produce different pitches. A sample can be played as a one shot, used\noften for percussion or short duration sounds, or it can be looped, which allows\nthe tone to sustain or repeat as long as the note is held. Samplers usually\ninclude a filter, envelope generators, and other controls for further\nmanipulation of the sound. Virtual samplers that store the samples on a hard\ndrive make it possible for the sounds of an entire orchestra, including multiple\narticulations of each instrument, to be accessed from a sample library.

The\nresults are then used to resynthesize the sound using a band of oscillators. The\nvocoder, linear predictive coding, and some forms of speech synthesis are based\non analysis/resynthesis.[citation needed]</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sound Synthesis","date":"2020-11-22","slug":"sound-synthesis"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"sound-synthesis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1809294066","2793165914"]}
