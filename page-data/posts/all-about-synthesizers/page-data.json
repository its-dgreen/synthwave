Synthesizers generate audio through methods\nincluding subtractive synthesis, additive synthesis, and frequency modulation\nsynthesis. These sounds may be shaped and modulated by components such as\nfilters, envelopes, and low-frequency oscillators. Synthesizers are typically\nplayed with keyboards or controlled by sequencers, software, or other\ninstruments, often via MIDI.</p>\n<p>Synthesizer-like instruments emerged in the United States in the mid-20th\ncentury with instruments such as the RCA Mark II, which was controlled with\npunch cards and composed of hundreds of vacuum tubes. The Moog synthesizer,\ndeveloped by Robert Moog and first sold in 1964, is credited for pioneering\nanalog synthesis concepts such as voltage-controlled oscillators, envelopes,\nnoise generators, filters, and sequencers. In 1970, the cheaper, smaller\nMinimoog standardized synthesizers as self-contained instruments with built-in\nkeyboards, compared to the modular synthesizers before it. The first\nmass-produced synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7, was launched in 1983, popularizing\ndigital synthesis. Software synthesizers now can be embedded on single\nmicrochips in any electronic device.</p>\n<p>Synthesizers were initially viewed as avant-garde, valued by the 1960s\npsychedelic and counter-cultural scenes but with little perceived commercial\npotential. Switched-On Bach (1968), a bestselling album of Bach compositions\narranged for synthesizer by Wendy Carlos, took synthesizers to the mainstream.\nThey were adopted by electronic acts and pop and rock groups in the 1960s and\n1970s, and widely used in 1980s rock. Sampling, introduced with the Fairlight\nsynthesizer in 1979, has influenced all genres of music and had a major\ninfluence on the development of electronic and hip hop music. Today, the\nsynthesizer is used in nearly every genre of music, and is considered one of the\nmost important instruments in the music industry. According to Fact in 2016,\n\"The synthesizer is as important, and as ubiquitous, in modern music today as\nthe human voice.\"</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"All About Synthesizers","date":"2020-11-19","slug":"all-about-synthesizers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"all-about-synthesizers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1809294066","2793165914"]}
