Synthesizer clones are unlicensed recreations of previous synthesizers, often
marketed as affordable versions of famous musical equipment. Clones are
available as physical instruments and software. Companies that have sold
software clones include Arturia and Native Instruments. Behringer manufactures
equipment modelled on instruments including the Minimoog, Pro-One, TB-303, and
drum machines such as the TR-808. Other synthesizer clones include the MiniMOD
(a series of Eurorack modules based on the Minimoog), the Intellijel Atlantis
(based on the SH-101), and the x0x Heart (based on the TB-303).

Creating clones of older hardware is legal where the patents have expired. In
1997, Mackie lost their lawsuit against Behringer as copyright law in the United
States did not cover their circuit board designs. In 2006, Roland and Behringer
reached a settlement after Roland claimed Behringer's effects units were too
similar to its Boss pedals.
